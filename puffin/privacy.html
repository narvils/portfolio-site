        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: April 29, 2025</p>

        <p><strong>Puffin</strong> is a personal vape tracking app designed to help individuals reduce or better understand their nicotine consumption. Your privacy is important, and this policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Puffin does <strong>not</strong> collect, track, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). All data you enter — including vape sessions, puffs, nicotine levels, or settings — remains stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.</p>

        <h2>2. iCloud & Device Sync</h2>
        <p>If iCloud sync is enabled (optional and coming in a future update), your app data may be stored in your personal iCloud account. This is managed by Apple, and we do not access or store that data.</p>

        <h2>3. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
        <p>All subscriptions are handled securely through Apple’s in-app purchase system (StoreKit). We do <strong>not</strong> store or process any payment or billing information. You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime through your Apple ID settings.</p>

        <h2>4. Analytics</h2>
        <p>Puffin does not currently use any third-party analytics tools. No usage data is transmitted externally. If anonymous analytics are introduced in the future, they will be strictly opt-in and privacy-first.</p>

        <h2>5. Push Notifications</h2>
        <p>With your permission, Puffin may send local notifications (e.g., cooldown reminders or streak updates). These are scheduled and managed entirely on-device. No notification content is sent to external servers.</p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Puffin is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect any information from minors.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We recommend checking back periodically.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact</h2>
