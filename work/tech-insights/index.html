                    <p>A platform for semiconductor and microelectronics analysis, providing data-driven insights to help businesses with reverse engineering, technical analysis, and IP consulting. I worked on a comprehensive UI/UX redesign project aimed at improving both internal and external tools across web and mobile platforms. This included a branding refresh proposal, as well as an updated style guide to modernize their visual identity. Although the designs were not implemented, the proposal addressed the complex nature of their platform and improved the overall usability of their tools.</p>

                        <p>TechInsights specializes in reverse engineering and semiconductor analysis, breaking down complex technology products to provide valuable insights.</p>
                        <p>Their workflow starts with lab technicians conducting detailed teardowns of devices, capturing data like high-resolution images of components using advanced tools such as SEM. </p>
                        <p>This data is then processed, analyzed, and organized into a large library where teams can collaborate, annotate, and work with the assets. </p>
                        <p>Finally, all this information is used to generate comprehensive reports that offer in-depth technical and market insights to their clients.</p>

                        <p class="half">The capture process begins with a product teardown, where every stage is photographed and cataloged. The internal tool used for this process handles vast amounts of data, requiring efficient metatagging for organization and future searchability. The goal was to make handling this detailed data intuitive and efficient.</p>

                        <p class="half">I focused on a solution that minimised repetitive tasks and allowed intuitive way to tag a large amount of assets at once. Smart tag suggestions speed up the workflow considerably. Selective tagging allows working with selected assets only. Grid view with varying zoom levels and a list view allows the user to switch the workspace view that fits their task better.</p>

For chips undergoing reverse engineering, each layer is captured in ultra-high resolution using electron microscopes, creating detailed circuit maps. This data is then inspected at an atomic level by technicians who compare, annotate, and draw directly on the images, using specialized annotation tools.</p>

                        <p class="half">It was clear that there's a need for a single specialised tool that's integrated in the platform to streamline the capture and annotation process with collaboration features, since it's an integral part of the report creation. We identified the most common used annotation features and what they're used for. The tool also required advanced comparison tools, where the user can compare two or more images side by side, overlay them, and manipulate them in different ways. I designed a powerful tool with simplicity at its core, focusing on the most used tools, ensuring that even users with minimal experience can easily navigate through its features.</p>

                    <div class="half text-section">
                        <p>I prioritized a clean layout with a well-organized toolbar that keeps the most commonly used annotation features front and center. Each tool is represented by clear icons and is accessible from a toolbar that adapts based on the user's current task, reducing clutter and cognitive load. The original tool was too complicated and most features were not used. I identified the main purpose of each tool in the annotation process and simplified it, making sure that advanced features are still accessible.</p>

Working on such a complex platform pushed me to shift from a UI-first mindset to a UX-driven approach, teaching me how to tackle problems that I didn't fully understand yet. The comprehensive nature of this project, touching everything from internal tools to brand identity, allowed me to explore new challenges and grow as a designer.</p>
