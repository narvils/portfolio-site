				<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
				<p>Effective Date: October 16, 2025</p>

				<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the <strong>Framer</strong> app (“App”) developed by George Will (“Developer”). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

				<h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
				<p>Framer is a personal creation tool for adding borders, building carousels, and planning your feed. You agree not to misuse the App, attempt to interfere with its operation, reverse engineer it, or use it for any unlawful purpose.</p>

				<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
				<p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. By using the App, you confirm that you meet this requirement.</p>

				<h2>3. Data and Privacy</h2>
				<p>The App stores your content and settings locally on your device. No personal data is collected, stored, or shared externally by the Developer. If sync features are added in the future, they will be optional. See the <a href="/framer/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

				<h2>4. Subscriptions & Purchases</h2>
				<p>Framer Pro may be offered as an optional in-app purchase or subscription. Billing and renewals are handled by Apple via the App Store and are subject to Apple’s terms and policies. Manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID settings. Refunds, if any, are handled by Apple.</p>

				<h2>5. User Content & Rights</h2>
				<p>You retain all rights to photos, videos, and other content you import into the App. You are responsible for ensuring you have the necessary rights to use any third-party content. By using the App, you confirm that your content does not infringe any third-party rights.</p>

				<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
				<p>When you choose to share or post, the App may use the iOS share sheet to hand off to third-party apps (for example, the Instagram app). The Developer is not responsible for third-party apps or services.</p>

				<h2>7. Changes to the App</h2>
				<p>Features may be updated, added, or removed at any time without prior notice. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

				<h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
				<p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or reliability of outputs.</p>

				<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
				<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Developer will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data or profits arising from or related to your use of the App.</p>

				<h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
				<p>The App, including its design, code, and branding, is owned by the Developer and protected by applicable laws. These Terms do not grant you any rights in the App or its content except as necessary to use it as intended.</p>

				<h2>11. Termination</h2>
				<p>The Developer may suspend or terminate access to the App if you violate these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time by deleting it from your device.</p>

				<h2>12. Modifications to These Terms</h2>
