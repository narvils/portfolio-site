				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>Effective Date: October 16, 2025</p>

				<p><strong>Framer</strong> is a photography app that helps creators add borders, build carousels, and plan their feed. Your privacy matters. This policy explains what data we handle and how.</p>

				<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
				<p>Framer does <strong>not</strong> collect, track, sell, or share any personally identifiable information. There is no account system and no in-app analytics. Content you create (projects, exports, settings) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.</p>

				<h2>2. Photos, Videos, and Local Processing</h2>
				<p>When you import photos or videos, Framer processes them on-device only to render borders, layouts, and carousels. Exports are saved to your device’s Photos library. We do not upload your media to external servers.</p>

				<h2>3. Permissions</h2>
					<p><strong>Photos Library</strong>: Read/write access is used to import media and save exports you request.</p>
					<p><strong>Camera</strong>: Not required by Framer’s core features. If enabled in the future, it will be optional and used only to capture media you choose.</p>
					<p><strong>Notifications</strong>: Not used by default. If added later (e.g., reminders), they will be optional and managed on-device.</p>

				<h2>4. iCloud & Sync</h2>
				<p>Framer does not currently sync data to iCloud. If optional iCloud sync is introduced in the future, your data would be stored in your personal iCloud account managed by Apple. Framer would not access or control that data.</p>

				<h2>5. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
				<p>Framer Pro is billed through Apple’s in-app purchase system (StoreKit). We do <strong>not</strong> receive or store your payment details. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID settings.</p>

				<h2>6. Third-Party Content</h2>
				<p>Framer is designed for your own photos and videos. If you include third-party images, you are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to use them. Any bundled demo or onboarding images, if present, are licensed appropriately.</p>

				<h2>7. Sharing & Posting</h2>
				<p>When you choose to share or post, Framer uses the iOS share sheet to hand off to other apps (for example, the Instagram app). Framer does not see or collect anything you share outside the app.</p>

				<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
				<p>Framer is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 13.</p>

				<h2>9. Data Security</h2>
				<p>Your data stays on your device. Please keep your device and iOS up to date and use a passcode or biometric lock to protect local data.</p>

				<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
				<p>We may update this policy as the app evolves. Changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.</p>

				<h2>11. Contact</h2>
